# Cruise-lines
    
In this project, I analyzed the stock performance of two cruise line corporations: Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival Cruise Line. I analyzed their time series data since IPO, their moving average, volatility, Sharpe ratio, ETFs and their comparison to the Nasdaq Index. I also analyzed their performance before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and made prediction for the near future. Although they both suffered from the huge negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the first three months of 2020, we could see the stock prices began to resume thereafter. \\

I attached two files in this folder. One is the python code and the other is the PDF report.
