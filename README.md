# Cruise Industry - Quantitative Analysis on the stock price
    
In this project, I was responsible for analyzing the stock price for two cruise line corporations (Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival Cruise Line) from quantitative perspective. I analyzed their time series data since IPO, their moving average, volatility, Sharpe ratio, ETFs and their comparison to the Nasdaq Index. I also analyzed their performance before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and made prediction for the near future. Although they both suffered from the huge negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the first three months of 2020, we could see the stock prices began to resume thereafter. 

In addition, I combined all the python codes & output as well as the Qualitative analysis report(Written by Junting) together and formed a formal report through Latex. To help readers better understanding the purpose of doing this project, I also made a introductory video and slides to present our achievementã€‚
